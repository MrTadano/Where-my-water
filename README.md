# Resources Mod

Just a small mod that allows you to extract water from milk. I make this mod to have water in Lopi's Minimalism Challenge

### Bottle of Water
* 2x Sand, 2x Charcoal, 2x Milk, 1x Bottle -> 1x Bottle of Water _in 30s_

### Water
* 1x Bottle of Water, X1 Villager -> 1x Water in _10s_
